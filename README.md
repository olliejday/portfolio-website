# Portfolio Page

## TODO

* Mobile could add a small portrait image absolute positioned behind and bottom right, as have done on about page
* Try index page text to parallax rather than drop in/out? 
    - ie. divs remove overflow-hidden and then remove alpha on anim and change the ys to +/-50
* 🔤 Optimise css font imports
* 💡 Change some eg. previews to light theme?
* 📝 Favicons, metadata etc (don't want all from old portfolio but maybe some?)
* Test 🧾 Check hosted site again on firefox and chrome both on desktop and mobile
* 🖥 Add hinge clone and uncomment to add development back to nav bar
* Make readme a link to the portfolio for github users
