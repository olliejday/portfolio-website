## About

**User experience designer and developer based in the UK.**
Graduating in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh in 2021 and available for full time (from September) and freelance work.

I design interactive experiences, apps and websites but looking to learn new technologies.

Interested in technology driven by values and aligned with humanity. Exploring how technology can serve as a tool to support wellbeing, environmental and social good. How can we make life better for all, more present and connected rather than detached and distracted?

I have experience with AI and graphic design.
